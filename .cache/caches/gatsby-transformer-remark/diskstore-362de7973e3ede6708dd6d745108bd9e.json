I had been following and investing in cryptocurrencies that year - 2017 being crypto's big moment in the spotlight - and figured with my rudimentary knowledge of python I could code a bot that would net me profit off of the volatile bitcoin market.</p>\n<p>So I spent about an hour researching trading strategies, settled on moving averages, and started trying to backtest. After a few days of poring over graphs with great results, I realized I had misplaced a plus sign where a minus sign ought to be, and my algorithm quickly showed its true colors of unprofitability.</p>\n<p>The one time I did let it run live, with actual money, I turned it on and went to bed. I woke up the next morning to see it had almost immediately hit a network error and crashed, but not before netting me a 50 cent profit. Technically, I wrote a profitable bitcoin algorithm after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>These days</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"example.com\">Example.com</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">const foo = bar</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-javascript line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> foo <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> bar\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>foo<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hello</th>\n<th>Â World</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Foo</td>\n<td>Bar</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}
