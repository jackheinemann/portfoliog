## Trading Algorithms: A Personal History

Long ago, as a sophomore at NYU, I decided to take a crack at algorithmic trading. I had been following and investing in cryptocurrencies that year - 2017 being crypto's big moment in the spotlight - and figured with my rudimentary knowledge of python I could code a bot that would net me profit off of the volatile bitcoin market.

So I spent about an hour researching trading strategies, settled on moving averages, and started trying to backtest. After a few days of poring over graphs with great results, I realized I had misplaced a plus sign where a minus sign ought to be, and my algorithm quickly showed its true colors of unprofitability.

The one time I did let it run live, with actual money, I turned it on and went to bed. I woke up the next morning to see it had almost immediately hit a network error and crashed, but not before netting me a whole 50 cents. Technically, I wrote a profitable bitcoin algorithm after all.

Since then, I have learned a lot more about not only trading in general but algorithms and effective strategies as well. With a few more years experience under my belt, a chance article about commodities piqued my long-dormant algotrading mindset and got me thinking.

Cattle.

What if, instead of relying purely on technical indicators and price alone, there was an asset that lived, breathed, walked, and mooed. Any number of things could influence how these cattle grow, what their abundance and quality is, and ultimately, what price they sell for at market.

So, now I set out to see if I can find any data that supports this idea. Using weather, global market conditions, feed prices, farmers' forum sentiment analysis, local cattle auction websites, and anything else I come up with, can I somehow predict cattle prices accurately enough to provide an edge?

First, I need a reliable source for historical price data, and historical weather data, both of which I have leads on. In my next post, I'll dive into the Farmer's Almanac website and some of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's horribly formatted data.

Stay tuned!
